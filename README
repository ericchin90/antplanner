Welcome to Ant Planner!

=== OVERVIEW ===

Ant Planner is a tool for helping students of the UC Irvine schedule classes. 
As most students know, the Schedule of Classes (Web Soc) does a sub-par job of 
displaying information in a useful manner. Planning for classes is a menial task 
and Web Soc does not help at all. Ant Planner aims to ease this process by 
providing extensions to Web Soc for filtering classes and creating a more streamlined 
interface. Most importantly, a weekly calendar for seeing course times laid out in 
an organized manner, an idea inspired by Zot Scheduler (http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~mlyang/scheduler/). 

Ant Planner is written in Python using the web.py framework and is meant to be
run on Google App Engine. If you would like to extend Ant Planner and build so it can 
be run without GAE, the pleasure is yours...fork! Ant Planner currently works in Chrome, 
Safari, Firefox, and Internet Explorer 7+


This is considered a beta release. Many features have not yet been 
implemented. Beware!

=== INSTRUCTIONS ===

Ant Planner uses Templetor templating system. When serving on GAE, templates need to be 
compiled before serving the pages since the Python parser module is blocked by GAE. 
After changes to templates are made, you need to issue the following before running to 
see changes:

	$python web/template.py --compile templates/
	
Then, to use the GAE GUI to run the app or issue:

	$dev_appserver.py .


=== DISCLAIMER ===
Ant Planner is not officially recognized by UC Irvine. The authors of this application are not 
responsible for anything that happens as a result from using the application. Use at your own risk! 
At the time of this release, WebSoc is version 3.2
