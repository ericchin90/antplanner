Welcome to Ant Planner!

=== OVERVIEW ===

Ant Planner is a tool for helping students of the UC Irvine schedule classes. 
The current UCI Schedule of Classes (Web Soc) does a sub-par job of displaying 
information in a useful manner. Planning for classes is a menial task, and Web Soc
does not help at all. Ant Planner aims to provide extensions to 
the Web Soc search tools, an interface that makes sense, and most 
importantly, a weekly calendar for seeing course times laid out in 
an organized manner.

This is considered an alpha release. Many features have not yet been 
implemented. Beware!

Ant Planner is not officially recognized by UC Irvine. Use at your own risk!
