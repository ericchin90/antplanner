Welcome to Ant Planner!

=== OVERVIEW ===

Ant Planner is a tool for helping students of the UC Irvine schedule classes. 
The current UCI Schedule of Classes (Web Soc) does a sub-par job of displaying 
information in a useful manner. Planning for classes is a menial task, and Web Soc
does not help at all. Ant Planner aims to provide extensions to 
the Web Soc search tools and a more streamlined interface. Most 
importantly, a weekly calendar for seeing course times laid out in 
an organized manner is the main focus, an idea inspired by Zot Scheduler (http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~mlyang/scheduler/). 

Ant Planner is written in Python using the web.py framework.

This is considered an alpha release. Many features have not yet been 
implemented. Beware!
